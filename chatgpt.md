You’re absolutely right—using an additional field like `next_record` is unnecessary when the records are inherently ordered and sequential by their IDs or another `order` field. Let’s streamline the solution to work directly with this natural order.

---

### **Updated Solution: Leveraging Sequential IDs**
If the rows are ordered by `id` (or another field like `order`), you can directly query the subsequent records during cascading updates without any extra fields. 

---

#### **1. Model Design**
Keep the model simple, without any extra fields for relationships:

```python
from django.db import models

class Record(models.Model):
    value = models.FloatField()
```

---

#### **2. Cascading Update Logic**
The cascading logic can fetch and update all records starting from a specific row based on the natural order (`id`):

```python
def cascading_update(record_id, new_value):
    """
    Update the given record and all subsequent records based on their natural order.
    """
    # Get the record to update
    current_record = Record.objects.get(id=record_id)
    current_record.value = new_value
    current_record.save()

    # Fetch all subsequent records in order
    subsequent_records = Record.objects.filter(id__gt=record_id).order_by('id')

    # Cascade updates to subsequent records
    for record in subsequent_records:
        new_value = some_function(new_value)
        record.value = new_value
        record.save()

def some_function(value):
    """
    Example cascading logic.
    """
    return value * 2
```

---

#### **3. Example Usage**
Here’s how you can test the solution:

```python
# Create records sequentially (IDs are assigned automatically)
Record.objects.create(value=10)  # ID 1
Record.objects.create(value=20)  # ID 2
Record.objects.create(value=30)  # ID 3

# Trigger cascading update starting from record ID 2
cascading_update(record_id=2, new_value=25)
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Updating record 2 from 20 to 25
Updating record 3 from 30 to 50
```

---

### **Advantages of This Approach**
1. **No Extra Fields**:
   - Eliminates the need for `next_record` or any relationship fields.

2. **Natural Order**:
   - Leverages the inherent sequential order of `id` or another ordering field.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - Fetches only the relevant records using `id__gt` or similar queries, ensuring minimal overhead.

---

### **4. Optimizations**

#### **a. Prefetch Related Data**
Minimize database queries during the cascade:
```python
subsequent_records = list(Record.objects.filter(id__gt=record_id).order_by('id'))
```

#### **b. Bulk Updates**
If many records need updates, use `bulk_update` to reduce the number of save operations:
```python
def cascading_update(record_id, new_value):
    # Fetch all subsequent records
    records = list(Record.objects.filter(id__gte=record_id).order_by('id'))

    # Update records in memory
    for record in records:
        record.value = new_value
        new_value = some_function(new_value)

    # Bulk save all updated records
    Record.objects.bulk_update(records, ['value'])
```

---

This approach aligns with your preference for simplicity and uses the natural order of records effectively, ensuring minimal changes to your existing data model.
